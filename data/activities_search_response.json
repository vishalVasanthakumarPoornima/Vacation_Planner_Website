        "description": "Let's get down to basics. Maybe you've heard that Bourbon can only be made in Kentucky. Maybe you're sick of ordering Bulleit because you can't think of another Bourbon you like. Maybe you've never even tried brown liquor. Whatever your situation, this is the place to start.\n\nBourbon Basics is a great way to get into whiskey as a beginner, or to develop your appreciation for spirits. Each guest will learn about three different American whiskeys that host Harry picks by getting to know you with complimentary tastings that will educate and expand your palate, ending in a final parting shot.\n\nThis is a whiskey tasting for the beginner or intermediate enthusiast. Harry has chosen whiskeys for hundreds of palettes and made new friends every step of the way. Through his experience you'll get insider access to his process and the tools you need to pick whiskeys of your own either when you're out at bars and the list seems impossibly long or when you're looking for a gift for that lovable snob in your life.",
